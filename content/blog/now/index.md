## *What I'm doing now. Updated July 2025.*

## Learning Etegami with My Wife

Amy and I have declared 2025 to be our Year of Art. One form of art that has enthralled us is
Etegami (絵手紙). Its charm lies in its dark sumi ink outlines that spread joyfully as you work the
brush, and its use of gansai watercolors bring a playful nature to each art piece. A work of
Etegami isn’t “complete” until it is sent to someone else (it is a postcard, after all). So if
you’re in my circle of friends and family, be on the lookout for these “picture letters” in the
mail. Follow our journey on Instagram [{{< icon "instagram" >}}etegami.love](https://www.etegami.love).

Amy is holding up two postcards. The first one is a painting of a golden ginkgo leaf. The second one is a painting of a red fall leaf. On the table in front of them is a gansai paint palette with 35 different colors, paint brushes, and various plants and flowers that they used as inspiration for their paintings. They appear in a classroom setting with various tables and chairs in the background."

## Personal Health

Since November 2021, Amy and I have been using a personal trainer to get us to exercise. At first, I begrudgingly went and merely “allowed the exercise to happen to me”. It took a while, but now I look forward to meeting with our trainers Jeff and Mario. I can finally say that “I am the one choosing to do the exercise!”

## Enjoying the Switch 2

I love Nintendo so much. Their games, characters, and worlds are my favorites to jump into. My wife and I are happily playing Mario Kart World on my Switch 2. (Mario Kart meets Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater? Sign me up!) 

While I agree that the Switch 2 Welcome Tour game should have been bundled with the system, I really like the idea of the Switch 2 creators *making an entire game* just to showcase the console’s meticulous detail and craftsmanship, down to its very screws. As a software engineer myself, I’ve dreamed of the opportunity to explain in great detail how a particularly complex piece of UI was made, or how elegant the data flow is from one part of an app to another. For now, I live vicariously through the Switch 2 team which was able to do just that with their Welcome Tour game.

## Building this Blog

Oh yeah! I’m also building this blog! I chose to use the Hugo static site generation tool and host
it via GitHub Pages. This way, I have control over how I can express myself and how my content
appears. The best part: I’m not beholden to any popular blogging platforms or newsletter services. I
look forward to conveying my thoughts and beliefs on this blog, sort of like a public journal, and
also providing advice and life tips to those who want to follow a similar path to me as a Software
Engineer in Silicon Valley.
